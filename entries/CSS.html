    <h1>CSS </h1><br>

    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a fundamental web technology used for styling HTML elements, defining the layout, appearance, 
        and presentation of web pages. It enables developers to control typography, colors, spacing, and positioning, facilitating 
        the creation of visually appealing and user-friendly websites. With CSS, designers can apply styles consistently across 
        multiple pages, ensuring a cohesive brand identity and enhancing user experience. Its modular and cascading nature allows 
        for easy maintenance and updates, empowering developers to adapt and refine the look and feel of web content efficiently.</p>
